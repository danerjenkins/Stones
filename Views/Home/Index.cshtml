        <h1>How to Play Stones</h1>
        <p>Below are the basic rules to start playing Stones:</p>

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
            The objective of Stones is to control the most territory on the board. Players alternate placing their stones (black and white)
            on the intersections of the grid. The game ends when both players pass their turns, and the player controlling more territory wins.
        </p>
   

        <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Board:</strong> The game is played on a 19x19 grid, though smaller sizes (like 9x9 or 13x13) can be used for quicker games.</li>

            <li><strong>Placing Stones:</strong> Players take turns placing one stone per turn on an empty intersection.</li>

            <li><strong>Capturing Stones:</strong> Stones are captured by completely surrounding them on all orthogonal sides (up, down, left, right).</li>

            <li><strong>Passing:</strong> Players may pass their turn if no advantageous move is available.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Endgame and Scoring</h2>
        <p>
            The game ends when both players pass consecutively. The board is then divided into regions controlled by each player.
            Each empty intersection within a player's controlled area counts as a point.
        </p>

        <h2>Why I Love Stones</h2>
        <p>
            I first learned about Stones from the "Wheel of Time" books, and it immediately sparked my interest. What I love most about the game is
            its strategy and the elegant simplicity of its rules. Despite being a beginner, I’ve already learned so much, and I continue to be amazed by
            how much depth there is in every match. The aesthetic of the game is also something that draws me in – the quiet focus, the smooth stones,
            and the strategic beauty of it all make every game feel both calming and exhilarating at the same time. Stones is a game that keeps me
            coming back, always eager to learn more.
